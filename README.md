# Future community discussion

Based on [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) example of react-rethinkdb.

## How do I run this?

* Type `rethinkdb` to start a RethinkDB server on `localhost` port `29015`
* Run `npm install` to set up the app
* Run `npm run resetdb` to reset a database with name `react_example_todomvc`
* Run `npm start` to start the web server
* Navigate to http://localhost:8015/ in your browser

If you open two browsers, navigate to the app, each browser will immediately
see changes made by the other browser.
